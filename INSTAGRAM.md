## 1. ALGORITHM & POSTING STRATEGY

### How the Algorithm Works in 2025

Three signals matter most:

| Priority | Signal | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **#1** | Watch Time | How long people watch your content, especially Reels |
| **#2** | Likes Per Reach | The percentage of viewers who like your post |
| **#3** | Sends Per Reach | How often people share your content via DM |

**Key 2025 Updates:**
- **Topic Clarity**: Stay focused on wedding entertainment content
- **Originality Rewarded**: Avoid watermarks and reposts
- **Messaging Emphasis**: DM shares are heavily weighted

### Optimal Posting Frequency

- **Minimum**: 2-3 times per week
- **Optimal**: 1-2 times per day for maximum growth
- **Stories**: Post frequently to maintain audience retention

### Best Times to Post for Wedding Industry

| Day | Best Times | Notes |
|-----|------------|-------|
| **Tuesday** | 11 AM - 2 PM | High engagement |
| **Wednesday** | 11 AM - 3 PM | Highest engagement overall |
| **Thursday** | 11 AM - 2 PM, 5-7 PM | Strong performance |
| **Avoid** | Saturday | Lowest engagement |

### Content Format Performance

| Format | Best For | Performance |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **Reels** | Discovery & new followers | 36% more reach than carousels |
| **Carousels** | Engagement with existing followers | 12% more engagement than Reels |
| **Stories** | Audience retention | Reduces unfollows, builds connection |

**Strategic Mix:**
- Reels: 50-60% (for discovery)
- Carousels: 25-30% (for engagement)
- Single photos/Stories: 15-20%

## 2. CONTENT TYPES THAT WORK

### High-Performing Content Categories

**1. Dance Floor Clips (Highest Converting)**
- Packed dance floors with all ages
- Party lights and smoke machine effects
- Crowd reactions and energy moments

**2. Behind-the-Scenes**
- Day in the life of a wedding DJ
- Equipment setup and soundcheck
- Venue arrival and prep

**3. Client Testimonials**
- Video snippets of happy clients
- Screenshots of reviews
- Before/after stories

**4. Live Musician Showcases (COS Differentiator)**
- "Meet the band" posts
- Rehearsal teasers
- Live performance clips with crowd reactions

### Caption Best Practices

**Length Strategy:**
- 60% short (under 150 characters)
- 30% medium
- 10% long (storytelling)

**First 125 characters are critical** - only this shows before "See more"

**Hook Formula:**
```
HOOKS:
- "This moment had everyone on their feet..."
- "3 songs that NEVER fail on the dance floor"
- "Watch what happens when the bass drops"
- "The groom's face when we played THIS song..."

CTAs:
- "Save this for your wedding playlist"
- "What song would get YOU on the dance floor?"
- "DM us 'MUSIC' for our top 50 wedding songs"
- "Tag a bride-to-be who needs to see this"
```

### Hashtag Strategy (2025)

**Use 3-5 hashtags** per post

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Location** | #JacksonvilleWedding #StAugustineWedding #FloridaBride |
| **Industry** | #WeddingDJ #WeddingEntertainment #WeddingMusic |
| **Niche** | #WeddingBand #LiveWeddingMusic #WeddingDanceFloor |
| **Branded** | #COSCelebrations #AEEntertainment |

### Location & Venue Tagging

**Always Tag:**
1. Venue's geolocation
2. Venue's Instagram account
3. All vendors (photographer, planner, florist)

**Why:** Venues reshare content, couples discover you through venue searches, builds referral relationships

---

## 3. REELS STRATEGY

### Optimal Length

| Content Type | Ideal Length |
|--------------|--------------|
| Trending audio | 7-15 seconds |
| General content | 15-30 seconds |
| Tutorials | 30-60 seconds |
| **Avoid** | Over 90 seconds |

### The First 3 Seconds (Critical)

**Hook Techniques:**

| Hook Type | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| **Pattern Interrupt** | Unexpected visual to stop scrolling |
| **Bold Claim** | "This one song ALWAYS fills the dance floor" |
| **Question** | "What would you do if THIS happened?" |
| **Teaser** | "Wait for it..." with build-up |
| **Promise** | "3 secrets to a packed dance floor" |

**Opening Ideas:**
- Start on the dance floor moment (not the buildup)
- Begin with crowd reaction shot
- Open with the best visual/audio moment
- Use movement in first frame (never start static)

### Text Overlay Best Practices

- **Font**: Sans-serif, 48-60px minimum
- **Contrast**: White text with black shadow
- **Safe zones**: Keep text in center 70-80% of frame
- **Pacing**: 5-7 words per overlay, 1-2 seconds each

## 4. COS/AE SPECIFIC STRATEGIES

### Showcasing Live Musicians (COS Differentiator)

**Content Ideas:**
- "Meet the band" personality posts
- Rehearsal teasers and blooper reels
- Side-by-side: DJ-only vs. live musician moments
- Solo instrument features (sax solo, guitar riff)
- Guest reactions to live music
- "The difference live music makes" comparison posts

**Messaging Angles:**
- "More than a DJ - a full entertainment experience"
- "The moment live music starts, everything changes"
- "What happens when real musicians join the party"

### AE Entertainment (Budget Positioning)

**Content Focus:**
- Value messaging ("Professional DJ without the premium price")
- Dance floor energy (same great parties)
- Testimonials emphasizing value
- Behind-the-scenes showing professionalism
