      "text": "We had the absolute pleasure of working with Corey as the DJ for our daughter's wedding, and we couldn't be happier with the experience. From the very beginning, Corey was organized and professional, making the entire music selection process so easy in what can often feel like an overwhelming decision.\n\nOur wedding planner even noted that Corey was the only vendor who proactively reached out to review the timeline with her, ensuring that every detail flowed seamlessly—and it truly did. As an MC, Corey was outstanding. He kept the evening moving effortlessly, keeping our guests informed and engaged from the ceremony all the way to the final dance.\n\nOn top of his professionalism as a DJ and MC, Corey is an incredibly talented saxophonist. Many of our guests commented on how amazing the live saxophone music was and how much it elevated the entire evening.\n\nWith the support of his assistant, Noah, every transition throughout the night was flawless. Music has the power to both reflect and create the mood, and Corey did exactly that—he created an unforgettable, joyful atmosphere that made our daughter's wedding night truly memorable.\n\nWe cannot recommend Corey highly enough!",
