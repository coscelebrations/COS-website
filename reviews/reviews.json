      "text": "Words can't describe how special Corey and his team made my husband's and my wedding day at the Lightner Museum in St. Augustine. Being from Boston, this was a destination wedding, and Corey and Kyle put us at ease every step of the way. Any questions we had were answered right away and very thoughtfully, which truly gave us peace of mind.\n\nCorey made every single moment so special for us — he even played the sax during our entrance song, and it got the crowd going wild! We will truly never forget these moments and can't recommend COS Celebrations enough. We feel so lucky to have worked with them and will absolutely be using them again for future events.\n\nCorey is hands down the best DJ we could have ever asked for. He read the room perfectly, kept the energy high all night, and had every single guest on the dance floor. The music, the vibes, the transitions — everything was flawless. If you want a DJ who truly elevates your wedding and creates an unforgettable party, Corey is your guy.",

From the very beginning, Corey was organized and professional, making the entire music selection process so easy in what can often feel like an overwhelming decision.\n\nOur wedding planner even noted that Corey was the only vendor who proactively reached out to review the timeline with her, ensuring that every detail flowed seamlessly—and it truly did. As an MC, Corey was outstanding. He kept the evening moving effortlessly, keeping our guests informed and engaged from the ceremony all the way to the final dance.\n\nOn top of his professionalism as a DJ and MC, Corey is an incredibly talented saxophonist. Many of our guests commented on how amazing the live saxophone music was and how much it elevated the entire evening.\n\nWith the support of his assistant, Noah, every transition throughout the night was flawless. Music has the power to both reflect and create the mood, and Corey did exactly that—he created an unforgettable, joyful atmosphere that made our daughter's wedding night truly memorable.\n\nWe cannot recommend Corey highly enough!",
