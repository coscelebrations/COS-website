## 🔧 GOOGLE INDEXING API

Submit URLs directly to Google for faster indexing. Run from each site's directory.

```bash
npm run seo:index           # Submit all sitemap URLs to Google
npm run seo:index:changes   # Only submit pages modified since last indexed
npm run seo:index:check     # Show pages needing (re)indexing
npm run seo:index:dry       # Preview URLs without submitting
npm run seo:index:status    # Check submission status via API
npm run audit               # Full site audit (includes indexing check)
```

**Notes:**
- Daily limit: ~200 URLs per day (plenty for both sites)
- Submission ≠ Indexing: Google decides whether to index based on content quality
- Credentials stored in `scripts/google-indexing-credentials.json` (gitignored)

## 🎯 "WEDDING DJ NEAR ME" STRATEGY

**The Opportunity:** "wedding dj near me" has 390 monthly searches in Florida — more than all other Jacksonville/St. Augustine keywords combined.

**How to Target It:**
1. **City Pages:** Include FAQ: "Looking for a wedding DJ near me in [City]?"
2. **Google Business Profile:** Service areas should include all cities we serve
3. **On-Page:** Emphasize being "local" and "based in [City]"
4. **Schema:** LocalBusiness with areaServed and GeoCoordinates

**Implementation Status:**
- [x] All COS city pages - FAQ added (Jacksonville, St. Augustine, Orlando, Tampa, Ponte Vedra, Amelia Island)
- [x] AE Jacksonville & St. Augustine pages - FAQ added
- [ ] Google Business Profile optimization (both companies)
