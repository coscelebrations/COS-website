## 📌 NEXT SESSION TODO
- [ ] **Add Live Musicians link to ~59 venue pages** — only 4 pages currently link to /services/live-musicians/ in nav. Bella Collina done as example. Pattern: add `<a href="/services/live-musicians/">Live Musicians</a>` after Private Parties in Services dropdown
- [ ] **Monitor Orlando indexing** — page repositioned as local team, re-submitted to Google. Check GSC in ~1 week
- [ ] **Update AE Google Business Profile** — website still points to affordable-entertainment.com
- [ ] **Enhance Live Musicians Page** — add photos, video clips, testimonials, pricing hints
- [ ] **Add award badge images** — user will find The Knot & WeddingWire badge images from email
- [ ] **Monitor Google Indexing** — check Search Console for homepage LCP improvement
- [ ] **Venue Partnerships Section** — add preferred vendor logos to COS homepage
- [ ] **Create new venue pages** — 40+ opportunities identified (see seo-data/new-venue-opportunities.md)
- [ ] **Apply hero LCP fix to venue pages** — 45 venue pages still use CSS background (lower priority)
- [ ] **Add venue cross-links** — venue pages should link to other nearby venues (e.g., Treasury → White Room, Casa Monica)
- [ ] **Add venue/city links to Pricing page** — high-traffic page has no venue links
- [ ] **Implement responsive images** — Treasury responsive images ready in `/responsive/` subfolder. Use srcset for mobile optimization. Smart photo tool at `scripts/smart-photo.py`

## ✅ COMPLETED (Jan 5, 2026 - Evening)
- [x] **Bento galleries on all venue pages** — Apple-style asymmetric grid with hover captions, lightbox (Treasury, Lightner, Timuquana, River House, Fountain of Youth)
- [x] **Epping Forest Yacht Club gallery** — processed Liz & Joel wedding photos, new hero, 7-image bento gallery
- [x] **Landing page /go/** — conversion-focused page for paid ads (noindex), trust strip, pricing, testimonial

## ✅ COMPLETED (Jan 5, 2026 - Late Night)
- [x] **Full internal link audit** — scanned 75 pages, 2,172 links total

- [x] **Added Live Musicians link to Bella Collina** — example for remaining 59 pages
- [x] **Created Instagram reel content** — "DJ Tip of the Day" with Lightner dance floor photo

- [x] **Full site audit** — ran comprehensive checks on COS & AE sites
- [x] **Contact form validation** — confirmed "How Did You Hear" required field working
- [x] **Fountain of Youth page** — verified Nicole + Adam photos, schema, links all good
- [x] **All internal links passing** — 75 pages checked, no broken links
- [x] **All images have alt text** — no accessibility issues found

### Audit Findings (Minor - Low Priority)
- **Page titles over 60 chars:** ~35 venue pages have titles 61-87 chars — not critical, Google truncates gracefully
- **Meta descriptions over 160 chars:** 8 pages slightly over — minor truncation in SERPs
- **Missing OG tags:** Service pages (/services/corporate/, /services/private-parties/, /services/weddings/) lack Open Graph tags
- **VIP Login page:** Could use canonical, OG tags, better meta description
- **Pricing Guide page:** Appears unused, missing meta tags (consider removing or redirecting)

## ✅ COMPLETED (Jan 4, 2026 - Evening Session)
- [x] **Homepage hero LCP fix** — converted CSS background to `<img>` tag with preload, fetchpriority="high"
- [x] **Orlando page repositioned** — removed all "travel from St. Augustine" language, added Orlando team (Marc, Khalil, Paul)
- [x] **Re-submitted 61 pages to Google** — including updated Orlando page

## ✅ COMPLETED (Jan 4, 2026 - Earlier)
- [x] **Image optimization audit** — resized 37 oversized images to 800px max (AE logo was 6831px!)

- [x] **CLS fix** — added width/height to logo images on all 138 pages (COS: 71, AE: 67)
- [x] **Font fallback** — added system font stack to AE to prevent font-swap layout shift
- [x] **Competitor research** — analyzed 8 Florida markets (see seo-data/competitor-analysis.md)
- [x] **Broken link audit** — no issues found on either site
- [x] **New venue discovery** — identified 40+ venue page opportunities

## 🔧 GOOGLE INDEXING API

Submit URLs directly to Google for faster indexing. Run from each site's directory.

```bash
npm run seo:index           # Submit all sitemap URLs to Google
npm run seo:index:changes   # Only submit pages modified since last indexed
npm run seo:index:check     # Show pages needing (re)indexing
npm run seo:index:dry       # Preview URLs without submitting
npm run seo:index:status    # Check submission status via API
npm run audit               # Full site audit (includes indexing check)
```

**Notes:**
- Daily limit: ~200 URLs per day (plenty for both sites)
- Submission ≠ Indexing: Google decides whether to index based on content quality
- Credentials stored in `scripts/google-indexing-credentials.json` (gitignored)

## 🎯 "WEDDING DJ NEAR ME" STRATEGY
