Continuing COS Celebrations & AE Entertainment work.

**Last session (Jan 4-5, 2026):**

1. **Photo organization** — 668 Fountain of Youth wedding photos (Nicole + Adam, photographer Gaige Lancaster) geotagged and organized in `~/Desktop/Pictures/Couples/`

2. **Website updates:**
   - Added 5 optimized photos to Fountain of Youth venue page with Nicole + Adam gallery
   - Made "How Did You Hear About Us" required on contact form (JavaScript validation)
   - Created white logo for CRM portal: `/images/cos-celebrations-logo-white.png`

3. **Instagram content** — Created 4 new post kits (#19-22) in `~/Desktop/instagram-posts/COS/` — inventory now 34 posts (22 COS, 12 AE)

4. **CRM portal branding** — Configured cosplanning.com client portal with COS brand colors (merlot background, soft pink tables, rose borders)

5. **Overnight audit (all clear):**
   - All 75 internal links working
   - All images have alt text
   - Schema markup verified
   - 61 pages re-submitted to Google
   - Contact form validation working

**Priority TODO (from SEO.md):**
- [ ] Monitor Orlando indexing — check GSC in ~1 week
- [ ] Update AE Google Business Profile — still points to wrong domain
- [ ] Enhance Live Musicians page — add photos/testimonials
- [ ] Create new venue pages — 40+ opportunities in `seo-data/new-venue-opportunities.md`

**NEW: Competitive Research Complete (Jan 5, 2026)**
Full analysis of 40+ DJs across 12 markets saved to:
`~/seo-data/competitive-research-jan-2026.md`

Key opportunities to test:
- [ ] A/B test "Check My Date" CTA vs "Request Information"
- [ ] Add date availability checker to homepage
- [ ] Create award badge carousel
- [ ] Display "500+ reviews" more prominently
- [ ] Add video testimonials section
- [ ] Sticky mobile CTA button

**Minor issues found (low priority):**
- ~35 venue page titles over 60 chars
- Service pages missing OG tags
- /pricing-guide/ page appears unused

**Context files:**
- `~/cos-website/SEO.md` — SEO strategy and session history
- `~/CLAUDE.md` — Brand colors, SEO rules, assistant instructions
- `~/seo-data/rankings.json` — Structured rankings data

**Useful commands:**
```bash
npm run seo:index:check    # Pages needing reindexing
