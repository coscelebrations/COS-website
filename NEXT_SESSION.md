Continue work on COS Celebrations and AE Entertainment websites.

**Context files:**
- `/Users/coreypeterson/cos-website/SEO.md` - SEO strategy and site history
- `/Users/coreypeterson/ae-entertainment/COMPETITIVE-ANALYSIS-2025.md` - National DJ competitor research (NEW)

**Quick status (Jan 3, 2026):**

- Live Musicians service page LIVE on COS (/services/live-musicians/)
- Hero trust strips added to both COS and AE homepages
- Internal links to live musicians page from 5 key pages (1 link per page)
- 61 pages submitted to Google Indexing API
- National competitive analysis completed (50+ companies, 12 markets)

**What was done last session:**
1. Trust signals added (hero trust strips with review counts, awards)
2. Created /services/live-musicians/ page with FAQ schema
3. Internal linking strategy (homepage, pricing, Treasury, Lightner, TPC Sawgrass)
4. Consolidated to 1 strategic link per page (SEO best practice)
5. Batched Google indexing submission (61 pages)

**Priority tasks:**

1. **Enhance Live Musicians Page** - Add photos, video, testimonials, pricing hints
2. **Monitor Google Indexing** - Check Search Console in 2-3 days (29 indexed, 36 pending)
3. **AE Google Business Profile** - Website still points to affordable-entertainment.com
4. **Venue Partnerships Section** - Add preferred vendor logos to COS homepage
5. **Date Availability Checker** - Needs CRM integration (user to set up)

**Competitive insights to implement (from national research):**
- Video content (like DJ Soundwave, Complete Music)
- Date checker widget
- Venue partnership badges
- Interactive planning tools

**Pages needing attention:**
- Orlando page dropped from rankings - needs investigation
- Live musicians page - "flesh it up" with media

**Useful commands:**
```bash
# Check indexing status
cd /Users/coreypeterson/cos-website && npm run seo:index:check

# Submit for indexing
cd /Users/coreypeterson/cos-website && npm run seo:index

# Start local server
