Continuing COS Celebrations & AE Entertainment work.

**Last session (Jan 5, 2026 - Evening):**

1. **Bento galleries added to all venue pages** — Apple-style asymmetric grid layouts with hover captions and full-screen lightbox:
   - Treasury on the Plaza (5 images)
   - Lightner Museum (5 images)
   - Timuquana Country Club (5 images)
   - River House (8 images)
   - Fountain of Youth (10 images, 2 galleries)

2. **Epping Forest Yacht Club updates** — processed Liz & Joel wedding photos (She Exposure), new hero image, 7-image bento gallery with drummer shot

3. **Landing page created** — `/go/` for paid ads with:
   - Hero with DJ + Live Saxophone headline
   - Trust strip (500+ reviews, touring credits, awards)
   - Features, gallery, testimonial, transparent pricing
   - noindex/nofollow for ad traffic only
   - Mobile responsive

4. **Documentation updated:**
   - Rule #11 added to CLAUDE.md — Bento Gallery pattern for all venue pages
   - Full CSS, HTML, JS templates included

**Key files created/modified:**
- `/go/index.html` — Landing page for paid ads
- `~/CLAUDE.md` — Added Rule #11 (Bento Gallery)
- 5 venue pages updated with bento galleries

**Priority TODO (from SEO.md):**
- [ ] Add Live Musicians link to ~59 venue pages
- [ ] Monitor Orlando indexing — check GSC in ~1 week
- [ ] Update AE Google Business Profile — still points to wrong domain
- [ ] Enhance Live Musicians page — add photos/testimonials
- [ ] Create new venue pages — 40+ opportunities in `seo-data/new-venue-opportunities.md`

**Context files:**
- `~/cos-website/SEO.md` — SEO strategy and session history
- `~/CLAUDE.md` — Brand colors, SEO rules, assistant instructions (includes Rule #11 Bento Gallery)
- `~/seo-data/competitive-research-jan-2026.md` — Full competitive analysis
- `~/seo-data/rankings.json` — Structured rankings data

**Useful commands:**
```bash
npm run seo:index:check    # Pages needing reindexing
npm run audit              # Full site audit
python3 -m http.server 8000  # COS localhost
